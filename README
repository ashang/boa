This is Boa, a high performance web server for Unix-alike computers,
covered by the Gnu General Public License.  This is version 0.92r,
released 11 February, 2000.  It is well tested and appears to be of
production quality, given some limitations spelled out in the
documentation.  There is a new production branch of Boa, the 0.94
series, that should be used instead of this one for most purposes.
See the www.boa.org web site for more information.

Boa was created by Paul Phillips <psp@well.com>.  It is now being
maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle <ldoolitt@jlab.org>
and Jon Nelson <nels0988@tc.umn.edu>.
